https://github.com/goloroden/node-assertthat

All function of the original are working fine. All tests of these functions a green. 
For more information of these functions have a look to node-asserthat.

#How to:

It`s very easy to use this. Clone this projekt an run the `test.html`.
Thats it!

You are able to add your own tests by doing a simple script include:
 ```
<script type="text/javascript" src="test/myTest.js"></script>
```

#DOM - Testing

In my workflow with an own projekt a saw that i need some DOM - Testing functions too. 
I tried to start this by adding new function, that starts with `has.` These functions are not stable. I started do do my fist tests.
But they have done some good jobs unitl now.

For more Information watch the issue.
